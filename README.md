# Modeling Coral Reef Bleaching
*Final project for [MATH 340: Modeling Biological Systems](https://bulletin.geneseo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=20426) — SUNY Geneseo*
  
  
## Project Intro/Objective
This project modeled coral reef bleaching by examining how rising ocean temperatures impact the population dynamics of three types of zooxanthellae, the symbiotic algae essential to coral health. Using Lotka-Volterra competition equations and parameters such as carrying capacity and competitive dominance, we simulated a 2°C ocean temperature increase over 100 years. Our model found that warmer temperatures shift competitive advantage from heat-sensitive zooxanthellae to more heat-tolerant types, ultimately leading to reduced overall zooxanthellae populations and widespread bleaching. To take our analyses a step further, we could work to produce actionable insights about coral and zooxanthellae to help other professionals find survival strategies for these essential organisms while ocean temperatures continue to rise.
